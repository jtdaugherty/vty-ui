\chapter{Guided Tour of Built-In \vtyui\ Widgets}
\label{chap:guided_tour}

\vtyui\ provides a broad set of widgets for controlling layout,
presenting text, and interacting with the user.  In this chapter we'll
cover these built-in widgets and their APIs at a high level.  With
this knowledge you should be able to bring them together to build rich
interfaces.  As always, consult the API documentation for some of the
finer details.

For each major type of widget in the library, we'll give examples of
creation, usage, and any relevant functions.  Some widgets, such as
borders and fills, have horizontal and vertical variants; in this
chapter we'll cover the usage of one of these variants and refer you
to the API documentation for the others.
