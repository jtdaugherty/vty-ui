-- |This module is the core of this library; it provides
-- infrastructure for creating new types of widgets and extending
-- their functionality.  This module provides various bits of
-- infrastructure, including:
--
-- * modeling user interface widgets
--
-- * managing changes in focus between widgets
--
-- * managing widget state
--
-- This module does not provide any concrete widget types.  For
-- in-depth discussion on this module's API and widget implementation
-- in particular, see the Vty-ui User's Manual.
